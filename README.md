While throwing around ideas on what fun things we could do with financial data obtained from the internet, we decided implementing a Pok√©mon-style battle simulator would be interesting and a pretty decent challenge (it's more complicated than you think)! The higher the Company's stocks, the more powerful its equivalent Stockemon.

The backend battle engine was written from scratch, as well as the animation engine on the front-end. It allows users to play with each other and battle their stocks to see who can reign supreme.
